# 🦀 StellarFlow-Contracts
*The High-Fidelity Oracle for African Corridors on Soroban.*

StellarFlow is a decentralized data oracle built on the Stellar Network. It provides real-time, verified exchange rates for African currencies (NGN, KES, GHS) to the Soroban ecosystem, enabling the next generation of localized DeFi, cross-border payments, and yield protocols.

# 🏛️ Architecture Overview
The contract acts as a secure, authorized ledger for price data. It is designed to be:

Authorized: Only whitelisted providers (Relayers) can update prices.

Immutable: All updates are time-stamped and emitted as events for transparency.

Interoperable: Designed to be called by other Soroban smart contracts (C2C).

# 🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
> Rust

Soroban CLI
> Target: wasm32-unknown-unknown

### Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/SFN/stellarflow-contracts.git
cd stellarflow-contracts
```

**Build the contract:**

```Bash
soroban contract build 
```

# 🛠️ Public Interface (API)
**Admin Functions**
> initialize(admin: Address): Sets the global contract administrator.

> add_provider(provider: Address): Whitelists a backend relayer to push data.

> rescue_tokens(token: Address, to: Address, amount: i128): Admin-only function to recover trapped assets from the contract.

**Data Submission (Authorized)**
update_price(source: Address, asset: Symbol, price: i128): Updates the price for a specific asset. Requires source authorization.

**Data Retrieval (Public)**
> get_price(asset: Symbol) -> PriceData: Returns the latest price, timestamp, and provider info.

> get_all_assets() -> Vec<Symbol>: Returns a list of all currently tracked currency pairs.

# 🧪 Testing Policy

***We maintain a "No Test, No Merge" policy.***

All Pull Requests (PRs) must include a updated test.rs file. To run the test suite:

```Bash
cargo test
```

**Tests must verify:**

> Success Paths: Correct data storage and retrieval.

> Security Paths: Rejection of unauthorized update_price calls.

> Edge Cases: Handling of missing assets or zero-value inputs.
